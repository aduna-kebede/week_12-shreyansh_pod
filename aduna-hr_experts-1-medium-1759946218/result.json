She might not have been added to our HR system yet\n3. There could be a different email address registered for her\n\nTo proceed with processing the leave request, I'll need to verify her employment status in our system. Would you be able to provide:\n1. Any alternative spellings of her name that might be in our system\n2. Any alternative email addresses she might be using\n3. Her employee ID if you have access to it through another source\n\nAlternatively, if you have administrative access to the HR system, you might want to verify her information directly before we proceed with the leave request."
