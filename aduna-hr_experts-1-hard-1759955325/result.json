Created employee record linking her to the Marketing Specialist position (Employee ID: 101)\n3. Enrolled her in the mandatory GDPR Compliance Training program (Training Record ID: 343)\n4. Set up her benefits with employee-only coverage under the Blue Cross Blue Shield Health Plan (Benefits Enrollment ID: 271)\n5. Verified that Tina Hale (HR Manager) has all necessary approvals for these actions\n6. Created audit logs for all actions performed:\n   - User creation (Log ID: 2885)\n   - Employee record creation (Log ID: 2886)\n   - Training enrollment (Log ID: 2887)\n   - Benefits enrollment (Log ID: 2888)\n\nAll required approvals are in place and the complete audit trail has been established according to company policy. Sarah's onboarding is now fully documented and compliant with our procedures.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to help with regarding Sarah's onboarding or any other HR-related tasks?"
